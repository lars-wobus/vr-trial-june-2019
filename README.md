## Summary

The main intention of this project was to develop a VR game within 3 days. 

- Because my major background is programming, I wanted to improve my skills as a modeller, an animator as well as a project manager.
- But the project should also serve as a proof of concept for future contracts.

- Humanoid coffee mugs
